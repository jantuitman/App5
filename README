App5 

App5 is a javascript GUI / application library. You can make iPhone / iPad / browser / <... insert other device here .. > gui's with this library.
It also contains an objective c wrapper to run your html code natively.

Note: it is currently in major redesign. The documentation and development branch are updated.
The master branch contains a relatively stable, but not "guaranteed to work" merged version of the dvl branch.
When ready, (expect: october 2011) the dvl branch will be merged to the master.

For now: you can read the documentation on http://jantuitman.github.com/App5/
