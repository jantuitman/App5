+Tools

in the root directory of App5 you'll find a shell script named app5.
It runs the (Rhino) javascript tools/app5.js

You can use the following commands:

- app5 generate <dir> 
- app5 server <dir> <basedir> 
- app5 ios 
- app5 production

These commands are described below in detail.

++app5 generate <dir>

generate a new application. As parameter you supply a directory name which is also the application name. App5 creates a directory with this name in the current directory.

The directory will have the following dirs/files:

- www
- www/index.html
- www/scripts
- www/scripts/main.js
- target

www is supposed to be the directory containing all your html/css/javascript.
index.html, main.js are your startup files. 
target is a destination directory in which minified www and IOS xcode projects are placed.

++app5 server

use this command to start a webserver if you want to test your app5 app in your browser. ``app5 server`` serves the current directory, and adds to it all files that are in the APP5_HOME/lib directory. (The app5 library files).

If you want to do customized things, you can override your application directory and the home directory of the library in the command line.

Called with 1 argument, the command overrides the APP5_HOME/lib directory (``app5 <basedir>``). Called with two arguments (``app5 <dir> <basedir>``) both locations are overridden.

The server starts on port 8888. 

++app5 ios
copies the wrapper from APP5_HOME/ios_wrapper to target/ios_wrapper, and copies the files from both APP5/lib and your app, into the wrapper's www directory. If the ios_wrapper is already present in target, only the www is updated.

++app5 production
creates a minimized version of the www, both in the target/ios_wrapper/www (if present) and in target/www.
